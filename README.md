7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 
    1. Introduction
This document outlines the steps taken to set up a developer environment using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the primary text editor. It includes installation instructions, configurations, customizations, and troubleshooting steps encountered during the setup process.

2. Installation of Visual Studio Code
Step 1: Downloading VS Code
Navigate to the Visual Studio Code website.
Click on the download button for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).![alt text](<Screenshot (3).png>)
Step 2: Installing VS Code
Once the download is complete, open the installer file.
Follow the installation prompts:
Accept the license agreement.
Select the destination folder (default is usually fine).
Choose additional tasks (e.g., creating a desktop icon).
Click "Install" and wait for the process to complete.
Launch VS Code by clicking "Finish" and ensuring the option to start VS Code is checked. ![alt text](<Screenshot (5).png>) ![alt text](<Screenshot (7).png>) ![alt text](<Screenshot (6).png>)
